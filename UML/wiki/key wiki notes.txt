- In 1994 UML was originally motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design developed by a set of peers at Rational Software

- In 1997 UML was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG) and has been managed by this organization ever since

- In 2005 UML was also published by the ISO as an approved ISO standard

UML offers a way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a diagram including elements such as:
	- any activities(jobs)
    - individual components of the system
		*and how they can interact with other software components
    - how the system will run
    - how entities interact with others (components and interfaces)
    - external user interface

- Although originally intended for object-oriented design documentation, UML has been extended to a larger set of design documentation, and been found useful in many contexts

- UML 2 has many types of diagrams, which are divided into two categories
	*Structure Diagrams - Emphasis on the things that must be present in the system being modeled
		**Component Diagram
		**Class Diagram
	*Behaviour Diagrams - Emphasis on what must happen in the system being modeled
		**Activity Diagram
		**Use Case Diagram
		**Interaction Diagrams - A subset of behaviour diagrams, emphasize the flow of control and data among the things in the system being modeled
			***Sequence Diagram
			***Communication Diagram
	*Justin is most acclimated with Behavior Diagrams
		**Activity Diagrams
		**Use Case Diagrams
		**Sequence Diagrams

- Meta-Object Facility (MOF) is an Object Management Group (OMG) standard for model-driven engineering
	
- UML has been found useful in many design contexts. It has been treated, at times, as a design silver bullet, which has led to problems in its usage
	*Misuse of it includes excessive usage of it (design every little part of the system's code with it)
	*Assuming that anyone can design anything with it

- Model-driven engineering (MDE) is a software development methodology that focuses on creating and exploiting domain models, which are conceptual models of all the topics related to a specific problem

- UML is not a single language, but a set of notations, syntax and semantics to allow the creation of families of languages for particular applications

- Topics
	Extensibility Mechanisms (Profiles: Stereotyps, Tags, Constraints) -  generic extension mechanism for customizing UML models for particular domains and platforms
